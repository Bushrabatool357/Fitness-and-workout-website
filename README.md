 FitLife Website:
 
 Fitness Made Simple FitLife was born from a simple idea for my ICT semester project: fitness shouldn't be intimidating. While most health sites are overwhelming, FitLife is designed for real people especially students who need a clear, friendly place to start.

 Why It Matters

We skip the jargon and focus on easy-to-follow workouts and realistic diet plans.

Smart Tools:

A built-in BMI calculator gives users instant, personalized insights.

Student-Friendly: 

Designed for those juggling a busy schedule who want to stay healthy at home.

The Tech:

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site prioritizes a clean, "no-distraction" user experience that makes starting a healthy habit feel achievable.
